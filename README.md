# Analysis of DNS Protocol
Analysing and visualising the DNS packets to bring out insights of a DNS session using Python ,Scapy and few visualising tools. <br>
First , we need to make a data set for this analysis so we have written a python script for this . Using the scapy library in python extracting the DNS packets in a session was done .<br>
Next the following data is being exported to an Excel sheet and is sent for analysis.<br><br>
In following jupyter notebook the images are not shown but its being included here <br><br><br>
On query 18 we are displaying the <b> common types of Request-Response </b>, the graph for it is displayed below.<br>
